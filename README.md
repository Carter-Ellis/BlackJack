🃏 BlackJack — A Python Card Game 👻

A small BlackJack project I built on Halloween night to get more familiar with Python beyond solving problems on LeetCode. This project helped me practice object-oriented programming, Enums, and game logic design.

🎯 Overview

This is a simple console-based version of BlackJack, where you play against the dealer. The game simulates card dealing, scoring, bust logic, and even player's balance to place bets — all written purely in Python.

🕹️ How to Play

You start with two cards, and the dealer also draws two.

Choose whether to hit or stand.

Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over!

If you go over 21, you bust and lose.

After your turn, the dealer draws until reaching at least 17.

Closest to 21 wins 🎉

⚙️ Features

Object-Oriented structure with Dealer, Suit, Player, and Game classes

Uses Python’s Enum to represent suits

Randomized card drawing using the random module

Scoring logic for both player and dealer

Proper handling for busts and ties

Clear and formatted terminal output for hands and results

💻 Technologies Used

Python 3.14

Enum, dataclasses, and standard Python libraries

Developed in PyCharm

🧠 What I Learned

How to structure a small project using classes and methods in Python

Using Python Enums effectively

Managing collections like dictionaries and lists for state tracking

Implementing control flow for game logic

Writing more readable and maintainable Python code

🚀 Future Improvements

Add Ace logic (1 or 11 depending on hand)

Possibly a GUI version using Tkinter or PyGame
